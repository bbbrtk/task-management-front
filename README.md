# Project and task management web application
To manage and organize work in teams.
Using 3 levels of hierarchy (Manager, Client, Developer) you can create/update projects or tasks, declare states and steps, assign them to your co-workers, upload attachements, set deadlines and reminders and so on...
Inspired by task-management apps like [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/).
